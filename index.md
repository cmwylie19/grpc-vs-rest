## gRPC vs Rest
This is a simple application that requests an image from two distinc backends with two distinct databases. 
You can view the site [live](https://freshlist.us) to view the code running in production.

At this moment, the project is very young, and not finished. The production site will be changing rapidly as development ensues.

### Architecture
The application is running in Istio. We are using the envoy proxy to translate the gRPC streaming request to the frontend. `VirtualService` configuration will be seen at `vs-default.yaml` in the root folder. The `VirtualService` contains a frontend, an http-backend, and a catch all grpc-backend.

### VirtualService
The VirtualService responsible for translating gRPC streams to the frontend can be seen below. The frontend is a react app, the two backends are go apps (image and rest-image).
